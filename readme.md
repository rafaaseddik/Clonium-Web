### About and backstory
This game is a web adaptation for the addictive android game [BCG (Board Games Collection)](http://4pda.ru/forum/lofiversion/index.php?t632925.html).

During the 2020's Covid-19 lockdown, I got challenged by a friend to develop this game. So I accepted the challenge and finished the first version of the game in a weekend. And after a mounth of testing and enhancing the gameplay, this is the first fully functional version.

## Future goals
